When the  user enters the application (client code) they will see the first scene (scene above with number 1 on it) from here the user has two options either to exit the application from the quit button or continue to the game from the login button. When they click on the login button they will be asked to enter their username and password and choose either to play alone(with the computer) or with other players(multiplayer). When the user clicks on single or multiplayer go to scene 3.

Scene 3 is the game scene where the player can play in the 2d array and can choose where to put the token. They can reset the game from the play again button, quit the game from the quit button, view the record of the game from the record button, and go to the messaging scene to chat from the messenger button. From the messaging scene they can go back to the game scene.
